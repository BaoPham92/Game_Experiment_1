# Game_Experiment_1
1. Testing mechanics for building a game. Eventually to strengthen the current knowledge JS.

2. This respository is also a main focus of iterating through methods and knowledge I have learned from GA thus far.

// Let's get started.

// May 21st. 


// Built a base game mechanic for having wall bounds,
// enemy/player objects, created using the draw system to 
// display the objects, and even created a collision system.

// All in all. Everything seems to be in good order for now.
// Going to attempt to give a go at making health bars for 
// both oppositions now and also clean and streamline more 
// code for better clarifications.
